In my first notebook ( [The Story of Film](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-story-of-film/) ), I attempted at narrating the story of film by performing an extensive exploratory data analysis on Movies Metadata collected from TMDB. I also built two extremely minimalist predictive models to predict movie revenue and movie success and visualise which features influence the output (revenue and success respectively).\n","\n","In this notebook, I will attempt at implementing a few recommendation algorithms (content based, popularity based and collaborative filtering) and try to build an ensemble of these models to come up with our final recommendation system. With us, we have two MovieLens datasets.\n","\n","* **The Full Dataset:** Consists of 26,000,000 ratings and 750,000 tag applications applied to 45,000 movies by 270,000 users.

For one, it gives the same recommendation to everyone, regardless of the user's personal taste. If a person who loves romantic movies (and hates action) were to look at our Top 15 Chart, s/he wouldn't probably like most of the movies. If s/he were to go one step further and look at our charts by genre, s/he wouldn't still be getting the best recommendations.\n","\n","For instance, consider a person who loves *Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge*, *My Name is Khan* and *Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham*. One inference we can obtain is that the person loves the actor Shahrukh Khan and the director Karan Johar.
